# 📊 Data Science Case Studies with Machine Learning and Deep Learning

## 🧠 Overview

This repository contains multiple data science project case studies and problem statements that are analyzed and solved using machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks. Each project follows an industry-standard workflow implemented through Jupyter notebooks, reflecting how machine learning and deep learning pipelines are commonly developed and evaluated in real-world scenarios.

## ⚙️ Technical Description

This repository serves as a collection of applied data science case studies focused on supervised and unsupervised learning, predictive modeling, and neural network–based solutions. The projects demonstrate end-to-end workflows including data ingestion, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and result interpretation using established machine learning and deep learning frameworks.

## 🗂️ Projects Overview

This repository includes **six comprehensive project case studies** that demonstrate industry-standard machine learning, deep learning, and neural network workflows for prediction tasks and large-scale data analysis. The projects span traditional machine learning using scikit-learn to advanced deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), which are central to modern data science applications.

A strong emphasis is placed on **neural networks**, as they form the foundation of rapidly growing technologies such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Agentic AI systems, and MLOps pipelines. These projects are designed for **data scientists** seeking to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world case studies and **deep learning practitioners** looking for hands-on, practical assignments.

### 📌 Case Studies / Problem Statements

1. **🚦 LeNet Deep Network – Traffic Sign Classification**
   This case study analyzes and demonstrates a core component of autonomous and intelligent systems such as self-driving cars, robotics, and modern cybersecurity appliances. It explores the intuition and historical background of the LeNet convolutional neural network, optimization of network architecture to prevent overfitting, activation functions, traffic sign image classification, and hands-on usage of Keras APIs. Model performance is evaluated using confusion matrices and detailed classification reports.

2. **🚗 Car Sales Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks**
   This project focuses on predicting customer car purchase behavior, specifically estimating the price range a customer is willing to spend. Such predictions help optimize sales workflows and improve customer experience by narrowing down suitable vehicle options. The solution is built using an artificial neural network trained on features such as age, region, net income, and household income.

3. **🖼️ CIFAR-10 Image Classification**
   This case study covers digital image classification using deep convolutional neural networks. It demonstrates image preprocessing, data augmentation, weight optimization, and architectural balancing of neural networks. The CIFAR-10 dataset, a large-scale public dataset, is used to illustrate big data analysis concepts, with evaluation performed through confusion matrices and classification reports.

4. **🎬 Movie Recommendation System**
   This project demonstrates the design of an industry-standard recommendation system commonly used across domains such as movies, music, web content, search engines, and large-scale platforms. The system is built using user-based collaborative filtering and correlation analysis, leveraging user behavior such as watch history, ratings, likes, and interactions—similar to real-world systems used by Netflix, Prime Video, and YouTube.

5. **📧 Email Classification Using Naive Bayes (NLP)**
   This case study introduces natural language processing through spam and non-spam email classification using the Naive Bayes algorithm. It covers text preprocessing, tokenization, feature extraction using count vectorization, prior probability estimation, and model optimization—highlighting NLP techniques that underpin most modern generative and agentic AI systems.

6. **⭐ Yelp Review Classification (NLP)**
   This project focuses on classifying Yelp reviews from a large, crowd-sourced dataset using optimized Naive Bayes classification techniques. It demonstrates NLP workflows including tokenization, advanced feature extraction, vectorization strategies, and probabilistic modeling to distinguish between meaningful and non-meaningful reviews.

## ▶️ How to Run the Notebooks

The notebooks can be executed either locally or using Google Colab. For local execution, clone the repository, install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`, and run the notebooks using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. Alternatively, notebooks can be opened directly in Google Colab for cloud-based execution without local environment setup.

## 📁 Notebook Access Notes

This repository contains two separate notebook folders. One notebook folder includes files committed directly (for example, notebooks related to projects such as movie recommendation systems). Due to the complexity of these notebooks and the libraries used, GitHub’s default notebook viewer may sometimes display errors such as invalid notebook formats or web 404 issues. To address this, an additional notebook folder has been created containing the same notebooks opened and saved using Google Colab workspace features. These Colab-based notebooks are functionally identical but are more reliably viewable. Please check both notebook folders to ensure proper access and viewing of all projects.
